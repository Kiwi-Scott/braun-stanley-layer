# ðŸ”» Braunâ€“Stanley Layer

**A field-preserving, directional rectifier formed from copper sulfide.**

The Braunâ€“Stanley Layer is an open-source, experimentally reproducible junction that enables embedded rectification in wire geometry without breaking capacitive continuity.

## What it does
- Maintains displacement current paths
- Blocks reverse conduction
- Forms in place using copper, sulfur, heat, and DC bias

## Status
ðŸ”¬ Currently under lab testing (open source, public domain)
